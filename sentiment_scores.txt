0.0	I'm not needling, really I'm not.
0.25	Do you know, I had a dream an hour ago.
-0.3506	I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books.
-0.5574	You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me.
0.3182	I calmly parried every thrust.
0.0	Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said `Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!
0.4767	And I said, `Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that "He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.
0.0	Stick with the fireman, Montag.
-0.75	All else is dreary chaos!
0.0	Don't listen," whispered Faber.
-0.2263	He's trying to confuse.
0.0	He's slippery.
0.0	Watch out!
0.296	Beatty chuckled.
-0.6904	And you said, quoting, `Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!
0.6996	And I cried in good humour, 'Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!
-0.6597	And `The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

0.4404	And I whispered gently, 'The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.
-0.8016	And you screamed, 'Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!
0.4939	And I said, patting your hand, 'What, do I give you trench mouth?
0.0	And you shrieked, 'Knowledge is power!
